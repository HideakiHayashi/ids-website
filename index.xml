This additional requirement of knowledge poses an interesting challenge on top of the classic VQA tasks. Specifically, a system needs to explore external knowledge sources to answer the questions correctly, as well as understanding the visual content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created
&lt;a href="https://knowit-vqa.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a dedicated dataset for our knowledge VQA task&lt;/a> and made it open to the public so that everyone can enjoy our new task. We have also published several papers on this task.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.ids.osaka-u.ac.jp/ildi/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Society 5.0&lt;/a> using information science and technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the world of Society 5.0, innovations in IoT, Big Data, robotics, and AI will be part of everyday life, helping people lead active and high-quality lives, creating a super-smart society. This project encourages collaboration across projects and university organizations, thus promoting faster adoption of research results in real-world society.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Under this big project, we are working two sub-projects:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="social-sensing-for-society-50">Social sensing for Society 5.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sensing technologies that aggregate various types of information from publicly and ubiquitously available social probes including social networking services are essential for providing various services in the world of Society 5.0. We are working towards establishing a social sensing technology that can infer emotional states of people for timely services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="future-school-technology-for-society-50">Future school technology for Society 5.0&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Education everywhere is one of SDGs, and e-learning is one solution toward this.

Especially in the anterior, functional restoration is not enough; restored teeth should have similar color tones and light transmissions to natural teeth because the appearance of restored teeth when exposed to light varies greatly depending on the material used for the crown restoration device and the abutment structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, by analyzing the optical properties of various dental restoration materials and dental tissues via optical simulation, the behavior of light in natural teeth and dental restorations is visualized and analyzed for esthetic tooth restorations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In ophthalmology or any other departments, vessels in retinal fundus images provide rich information on the cardiovascular system of human bodies. We proposed a state-of-the-art method, coined
&lt;a href="publication/li-2020-a/">IterNet&lt;/a> for extracting vessels from retinal fundus images as in the (e) in the figure below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>On top of this technology, we also invented a new method for classifying vessels into artery/vein, which takes a two-step approach: We firstly segment vessels in input images using an IterNet-based method and then classify them into artery/vein with some post-processing.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://researchmap.jp/read0180483?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Noriko Okubo&lt;/a> at Graduate School of Law and Politics, Osaka University, we are studying to automatically evaluate how green laws are enforced in different countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green laws&amp;rsquo; participation principle consists of 1) the information access right, 2) participation in the policy decision process, 3) the judicial access; however, actual implementation varies country to country, and legal methodologies have been explored for evaluating their effectiveness. This work investigates legal evaluation criteria on the green laws&amp;rsquo; participation principle, analyzes Japanese participation system&amp;rsquo;s pros and cons in a comparative perspective, and propose some recommendations to establish the environmental democracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difficulty lies in how to automatically find out related legislations, cases, statutes, etc. in different languages. As the first attempt, we proposed a method for identifying the topic of such legal documents through analyzing citation networks in addition to classic topic modeling. The figure below shows citation networks among different types of legal documents (e.g., cases-prior cases).&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.dma.jim.osaka-u.ac.jp/view?l=en&amp;amp;u=6617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Fujioka&lt;/a> with Graduate School of Letters/School of Letters, Osaka University, we are attempting to create an AI for analyzing various aspects of Buddha faces in images.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focusing on the face of the Buddha image, i.e., &amp;ldquo;Buddha face&amp;rdquo;, we analyze the characteristics of the style of each region, era, and author using statistical and machine learning approaches based on images and 3D geometric data, building a genealogy of Buddha faces. This is to realize style judgment based on the knowledge obtained from data, not based on the experience of art historians, which promotes the globalization of the Buddha statue research and also helps to identify the genealogy of Buddha faces propagated through the Silk Road, giving a new perspective on the spread of culture in Asia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have built several interfaces to browse through a large corpus of precious Buddha faces for facilitating annotations on the basic meta-data on the statues, which will then serve as a source to train more sophisticated models for analyzing them.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For example, we built a model that can embed various information on target entities (i.e., Buddha status), such as authors, eras, places, etc., into a vector representation of images and use them for other tasks like classification, through the model below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With the dawn of the &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; era, a massive amount of data is being generated every day, be it from our day-to-day lives, or from cutting-edge scientific fields. What sort of analysis is required to extract beneficial information from such enormous data sources? Furthermore, how can this be done in a sufficiently timely manner? These questions are critical to the future development of many scientific disciplines, and our society as a whole. In pursuing a better world for future generations, we believe the key is whether or not we can create, and subsequently utilize, new intellectual value from this data.
We at Osaka University have established the Institute for Datability Science (IDS), with the chief aim of utilizing the wealth of data we have at our disposal. One core goal at IDS is the pursuit of a new scientific paradigm through &amp;ldquo;Datability.&amp;rdquo; This refers to the sustainable and responsible use of large data resources. In pursuit of this goal, we shall pioneer new academic disciplines in the domains of Life Science, Biomedical Science, Science and Engineering, and the Humanities, through sophisticated technologies of information science such as artificial intelligence, with the final goal of creating new social and economic value through interdisciplinary research projects. At IDS, we seek to build a highly productive working environment of co-creation and harmony, cultivating the next generation of scientists and engineers with &amp;ldquo;datability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
